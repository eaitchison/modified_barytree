BaryTree
========

   A work-in-progress library for fast computation of N-body interactions on multiple GPUs,
   BaryTree implements barycentric Lagrange and Hermite polynomial interpolation fast
   summation methods. The current code employs an OpenACC GPU implementation with MPI
   for distributed memory parallelization. 
   Modifications for CUDA GPU implementation.

Building
--------
This project uses CMake to manage and configure its build system. In principle, 
building this project is as simple as executing the following from the top level
directory of BaryTree:

    mkdir build; cd build; export CC=<C compiler>; cmake ..; make

Compiling OPENACC versions requires that a PGI C compiler be used. For more information
on building and installing, see __INSTALL.md__ in this directory.


Examples
--------
See the __examples__ directory for several example executables that use __BaryTree__
and the Trilinos __Zoltan__ library for load balancing, in addition to an example 
using the library's interface for C programs. See __examples/README.md__ for more
details.


Interfaces
----------
See the __interfaces__ directory for __BaryTree__ interfaces for non-C programs.
Currently, there is a Python interface and an example script using that interface.
See __interfaces/README.md__ for more details.
